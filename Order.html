        MILAN – Bringing the great blue sea and its colorful delights to women’s feet. 
        The Giuseppe Zanotti Icons project is back with an exclusive third drop. Called Coralli, 
        the series is a summer story brought to life through two exquisitely crafted silhouettes.
         Inspired by two archival styles—the Spipiott sandal (2004) and the Coralli wedge (2005)—the Coralli are intricately crafted,
          richly embellished shoes that are once timeless and of-the-moment; playful and sophisticated. 
        In other words, the perfect pairs for summer’s return and women’s reawakening to glamour.
